	    <strong>
Social networking has become an important part of online activities of Web users. Popular social networking    web sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn and Orkut have millions of users using them everyday.
	    </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
However because of their centralized architecture these sites present a major problem on users' privacy. Once the user has submitted their personal information to these sites they are saved at the site's servers and presentation of these information largely depends on the design of the social networking service rather than the users themselves. Many sites use these information for targeted advertising.
	  </p>
	  <p>
As a solution to above problems distributed social networks are introduced. Users in distributed social networks do not need to join any particular social networking service such as Facebook or MySpace. Instead, they choose a server which they trust to host their own data.
